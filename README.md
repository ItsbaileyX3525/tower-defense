# Bailey's cool minimal tower defense

Welcome to my tower defense game, it is very simplistic made for siege week 3 using as little time as possible!
I attempted to add as many features as I could with the little time I gave myself and quite a lot of it is half-assed
alas it works well and is fully playable from my tests!

## I can't play, i'm on mobile!

Well that is a shame, instead you can watcht the video below!

## What is BCMTD? 

This is a very simple tower defense game that puts your stright into the game with 150 cash, you can use this starting cash
to place down a tower and gain some money to place down more towers and see how well you can optimse
with the limited resources that you have and make it to the highest round you can.
I don't think its possible to get really high so the highest round you can achieve is round 12 but gl!

## Core loop

Pick a tower from the list and then place it down, thats all there is too it! 
Just make sure that the soldiers dont reach the end of the level!
